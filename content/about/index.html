    <h2>We are Berkeley students.</h2>
    <img src="/media/images/immersion.jpg" width="100%">

    <p>We are current students in the University of California&apos;s
        <a href="https://datascience.berkeley.edu/">online Master of Information and Data Science program.</a>
        We're sharing our experiences in this program with those who might be considering applying to this or similar online degree programs.</p>

    <p>Online degree programs are relatively new a mixed bag in terms of reputation. When we signed up we were definitely wondering:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Will this program be too easy? Am I going to learn the skills I need to become productive in this industry?</li>
        <li>Are online classes from a well-known university ultimately no better than what I could get from Udacity, Coursara, and the like?</li>
        <li>Is it worth the price tag, especially compared with free or nearly free online courses?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>These are questions we now feel prepared to answer. We can&apos;t promise we&apos;re not biased (we are deeply invested in this program after all!)
        but we do have strong opinions on what works and what doesn't in the program, and what we are getting and hope to get out of it.
        If you are considering this program or something like it I hope you will give some of these articles a read.</p>
