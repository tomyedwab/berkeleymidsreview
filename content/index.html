<p>Here is my story of what led me to my current adventure, and how the adventure has been for me so far. Who knows? You might find it
    intriguing enough that you also want to jump in to start your adventure.</p>

</p>

<p>About a year ago, my boss decided to let me take ownership of our company&apos;s Business Intelligence because he had become overwhelmed by
    too many responsibilities as our company grew and I seemed to be our Engineering Team&apos;s only software engineer who doesn&apos;t have an
    aversion to doing math.</p>

<p>Of course, I had no idea what Business Intelligence even means other than just some buzz words that one
    hears a lot, so my duties at the beginning were basically just following my boss&apos; instructions. Occasionally, my boss would explain
    the analysis results to me: Terms like &quot;p-value&quot;, &quot;confidence interval&quot;, &quot;chi-squared statistic&quot;,
    &quot;regression&quot;, and &quot;Bayesian analysis&quot; were used all over the place.
    They sounded vaguely familiar to me but were totally forgotten because it was a lifetime ago that I
    learned probability and statistics. It was pretty embarrassing, to say the least, that I had no idea what my boss was talking about.</p>

<p>I did not like the situation I was in. Not knowing what Business Intelligence is was not helpful for me to figure out what my role actually
    entails. Not understanding what my calculation does was not helpful for me to do my job properly. In addition, I did not like being given
    only piecemeal instructions, I wanted to see the big picture.</p>

<p>I decided to do something about the situation by looking up resources online.
    There were plenty of free courses online, and many were even produced by top-tier universities. Free is good. Being able to watch the course
    videos when I have time is good. I planned to check out the ones that sounded interesting. Nevertheless, something still felt lacking to me.
    Each course by itself is like a single skill. How are those individual skills related to each other? How do they fit together to form knowledge?
    It is still just piecemeal - it is not structured, cohesive learning.</p>

<p>I stumbled upon some information about UC Berkeley&apos;s Master of Information and Data Science program one day. The curriculum had me do a double take.
    The program provides an overview of Data Science, covering all major topics and aspects of Data Science including what I need to do my job and much more.
    It starts with establishing the core knowledge and then expands into advanced topics. Essentially, it lays out very nicely what one will work toward,
    why one wants it, and how one gets there. I was not looking into getting another graduate degree, but this program offered what I was looking for.
    I did not have to figure out what to learn and how to proceed! Thusly, a chance encounter, a few inquiries, and an application later I became a
    member of the cohort of spring 2016.</p>

<p>The first semester was the trying time that I had not experienced in a very long time. Going back to school after having left school eons ago took some
    getting used to. In addition, last time I was a student I did not have a job that I needed to juggle with school. This inconvenient little thing called
    &quot;work&quot; had a tendency to get in the way of homework, class projects, and weekly required readings. Being a couch potato during weekends is a luxury
    that I could not afford anymore, and while my employer allows us unlimited vacation time that we can take when we want to (within reason) the school does
    not give that much freedom. Therefore, vacation time is something that I would not have much of for at least a year and a half.</p>

<p>It sure doesn&apos;t sound fun, does it? It is now near the end of my second semester, and I have at least another year to go.
    I am sleep deprived, I miss being able to take time off whenever. There are TV series that I am dying to catch up on but do not have time for.</p>

<p>So after all this, you ask, how does it feel to be in this program? It is invigorating. It is eye-opening. It is challenging. It is learning. It is humbling.</p>

<p>The students are from all over the world and have various backgrounds. It is fascinating to learn about what they do, why they are in this program,
    and how they can apply what they learn from this program to their work. For example, some can apply what they learn to the video game industry so
    they can produce games that are more engaging and attract more players. Some can apply what they learn to the automotive industry to add to
    drivers&apos; convenience. Personally, I am glad that I can facilitate business decision making for executives at work. I think more critically
    about the A/B tests that we conduct. Some of the buzz words actually mean something to me now. My work and my study have
    started to complement each other. It is pretty neat.</p>

<p>If you still remember your college days, you know there are different types of professors and some professors are more popular than others. It is the
    same in this program. I have seen them go out of their way to make sure that the students understand and absorb the course material.
    Their enthusiasm is infectious. Outside of class, students communicate with each other and help each other. When you have a question, you ask
    and many other students will offer answers and advices. Don&apos;t feel overwhelmed, it is just camaraderie. It is one of the most valuable things
    one gets out of this program.</p>

<p>My adventure continues.</p>
