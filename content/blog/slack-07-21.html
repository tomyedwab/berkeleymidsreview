<p>It may sound like hyperbole, but I estimate that maybe a quarter of the value I get from the UC Berkeley MIDS program comes
    from my interactions with other students in our &quot;team&quot; (private group of channels) on Slack.</p>

<p>I don&apos;t mean to put down the value of the program itself - the courses are challenging, I&apos;m learning a lot from the faculty
    and from in-class discussions, and there are resources aplenty to turn to for advising or career advice. However, the reason
    I chose Berkeley in particular over other programs is my faith in the insights and support I could get from fellow students,
    and I have not been disappointed.</p>

<p>If you are putting together an online learning platform, there really isn&apos;t a shining example to copy for fostering a rich and
    vibrant community of students, a problem which is only exacerbated when the student body is spread out across multiple time
    zones and continents. What the 2U platform has attempted to do is copy some key concepts from Facebook: a wall (both a global,
    personalized one as well as class-specific ones), the ability for students to form study or social groups, and a contacts/friends
    list the purpose of which is unclear to me. They also allow students access to the same video conference technology used in
    synchronous classes to collaborate; this includes screen sharing, a shared whiteboard, etc.</p>

<p>I&apos;m going to give these tools collectively a C-. I&apos;ve used some of them with group members occasionally, they do technically
    work, but as social spaces they&apos;re a ghost town. Though the intentions were good, the tools you give people matter, and
    these home-grown pale imitations of a social networking site just aren&apos;t user-friendly enough. For collaboration we tend
    to use Google Docs and Skype, simply because they work better and are easier to use.</p>

<p>Luckily, almost as soon as I joined the program I was invited to the MIDS slack team started by one of the students, where
    I could immediately participate in a number of ongoing conversations. Channels include:</p>

<ul>
    <li>General discussion of the program, gripes, raves, anything.</li>
    <li>A channel for Bay Area residents to coordinate meetups.</li>
    <li>Discussions of interviewing and career prospects post-graduation.</li>
    <li>A support group for parents in the program (I am in this category and believe me it can be challenging!)</li>
    <li>Cool (or, more often, horrible) data visualizations to be shared and critiqued.</li>
    <li>Channels for individual classes to discuss the asynchronous material and upcoming projects.</li>
</ul>

<p>Slack is a great place to see what&apos;s on my fellow students&apos; minds, keep in touch with people I&apos;ve met through the program,
    and get honest reviews of classes I&apos;m considering for next term. There is also a sense of belonging and a sense of <i>esprit
    de corps</i> that I get from participating that makes the program feel less like watching videos in my bedroom and much
    more like being together on a campus.</p>

<p>Just this week, the school is announcing a rollout of an official school-sponsored Slack team. This is nice primarily because
    paid Slack gives you access to channel history (which is not true for the student-run one) but also because it demonstrates
    the University&apos;s willingness to listen to student suggestions and improve the program.</p>

<p>I really have not experienced any online communities that feel as natural as the ones I&apos;m a member of on Slack, whether for
    communicating with coworkers or others in my profession. It really adds a lot to my experience and the benefit I get from
    the MIDS program.</p>
