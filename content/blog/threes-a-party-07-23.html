<p>In my Berkeley experience, it has taken me time to discover the biggest strength of the Master of Information and Data Science
    (MIDS) program. The strength of MIDS resides in the coursework that encourages small teams of 3 to 4 people to work on
    real-world projects. Often times, these teams are comprised of individuals who live and work around the world in almost
    every industry. Not to mention the online environment that provides students 24/7 access to coursework and recorded live
    sessions. This accessibility enables those of us who live in an area without a vibrant data science community, or who are
    balancing a full-time job and family life to pursue a graduate level data science program.</p>

<p>As many have pointed out, there are numerous free alternatives to learn data science other than a graduate degree:
    <a href="https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-become-a-data-scientist-1?redirected_qid=59455" target="_">How can I become a data scientist</a>
    and <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-Data-Science-topic-FAQ" target="_">What is the Data Science topic FAQ</a>.
    One thing they cannot teach is collaboration. The MIDS program culminates in a capstone course where we combine the technical
    and analytic skills learned throughout the program into a real-world application. As a small group, we will focus on a real-world
    application and build a data science project using real-world data.</p>

<p>I have included some interesting past projects here:</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="http://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/projects/2016/tomographica" target="_">Tomographica</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/projects/2016/smartcam" target="_">SmartCam</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/projects/2015/rap_rap_analysis_project" target="_">R.A.P. - Rap Analysis Project</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/projects/2015/predicting_next_pitch" target="_">Predicting the Next Pitch</a></li>
</ul>

<p>For the select few, some projects have been highlighted in major publications, such as R.A.P:

<ul>
    <li><a href="http://www.marketplace.org/shows/marketplace-tech/marketplace-tech-monday-november-9-2015" target="_">Marketplace Tech - Rap Analysis Project</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Without the MIDS program, it would be difficult for me to find a team of data scientists willing to work on a relevant project.
    In coming into the program with the goal of breaking into the industry, every project (especially the capstone) could be used
    to showcase your skills to potential employers. In addition to highlighting skills, group projects build relationships and
    expands one&apos;s network into many industries.</p>

<p>I am a few semesters out from the capstone course, with some exciting courses to come: <i>W207 Applied Machine Learning</i>, <i>W209 Data
    Visualization and Communication</i> and <i>W251 Scaling Up! Really Big Data</i>. Not to mention current courses in progress: <i>W231 Behind
    the Data: Humans and Values</i> and <i>W241 Experiments and Causal Inference</i>. For W231 my groups project will be working with the
    California Department of Justice, <a href="https://openjustice.doj.ca.gov/" target="_">Open Justice Initiative</a>.
    It is the above course projects and relationships established I value and look forward to the most.</p>
