    <p>Here is my story of what led me to my current adventure, and how the adventure has been for me so far. Who knows? You might find it

    <p>It may sound like hyperbole, but I estimate that maybe a quarter of the value I get from the UC Berkeley MIDS program comes
        from my interactions with other students in our &quot;team&quot; (private group of channels) on Slack.<br>
